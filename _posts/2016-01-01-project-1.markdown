description: The What You Say Is What You Did project [WYSIWYD](wysiwyd.upf.edu) creates a new transparency in human robot interaction (HRI) by allowing robots to both understand their own actions and those of humans, and to interpret and communicate these in human compatible intentional terms. WYSIWYD also contributes to a qualitative change in human-robot interaction (HRI) and cooperation, unlocking new capabilities and application areas together with enhanced safety, robustness and monitoring.
